     When you\'re clear about what\'s\n
     niggling you, wiggle your niggle\n
     and allow yourself a few\n
     moments to relax and be\n

     <string name="text_about">
     Niggle works best when you\'re
     open to the fact that changing
     the way you see your niggle is
     what stops it niggling.\n
     \n
     First be clear about what\'s
     niggling you.\n
     \n
     You can make a note of it in the
     text box or just wiggle to move
     on.\n
     \n
     Allow yourself a few moments to
     relax and be mesmerised by the
     universal symbol of infinity that
     appears on your screen...\n
     \n
     Take your time to reflect on
     each of the questions, in your
     own mind, before wigglin for
     the next one. Wiggling (shaking)
     your device is what you do to
     get a new page or new
     question. You can also use the
     \'Wiggle\' icon.\n
     \n
     Hit \"Nailed it!\" if you want to skip
     any remaining questions and go
     straight to save and share, and
     to receive the universal wisdom
     that\'s in store for you today.\n
     \n
     Niggle is for fun and for playing
     alone and with friends!
